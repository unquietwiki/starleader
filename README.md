## What is this?

starleader is my attempt to do two things...

1. Demonstrate to interviewers my ability to code things ad-hoc, for a particular need.
2. Be able to guide myself (and others) through an Amazon interview, using their STAR method. This may be useful for other jobs as well.

## Disclaimers

***WIP: Dec 8, 2020; data saves & loads via JSON. Still want to do an HTML or PDF export too.***

1. This isn't an Amazon tool.
2. I can't guarantee this will get any of us a job.
3. If something doesn't work right, you'll need to report an issue and/or submit a patch.

Thanks!!!
